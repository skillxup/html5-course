        I’ve always had an interest in neuropsychology, and I couldn’t help but
        devour Susan Weinschenk’s book, Neuro Web Design back in 2009.

      <dt>Bulleted and numbered lists:</dt>
      <dd>
        I love bulleted lists. Lists make content much easier to digest. Even
        the slightest indention and bullet will draw the reader’s eye. Oh, and
        Google likes these too.

      <dt>Calls to action:</dt>
      <dd>
        Despite the intelligence level of your site visitors, people don’t want
        to have to think when they are browsing websites. Obvious
        command-oriented calls to action are key in moving visitors through your
        website. And don’t be scared to make the call to action a BIG BUTTON.
        Bigger is better, but don’t make it look like a banner.
