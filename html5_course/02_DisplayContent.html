    <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
      age-old adage,
      <strong> “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” </strong>
      can be a two-way street.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
      website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
      <u><a href="#">“brochure site”</a></u> gives me heartburn. But sometimes
      you have to pick your battles.

      <strong>Pre-writing questions: </strong> Before starting any given page,
      you really need to wrap your heads around the
      <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">
        primary goal of the page
      </a>
      and to whom this page is targeted. <br />
      <br />
      What’s their pain? <br />
      What’s in it for them? <br />
      Where are they in their buying process? <br />
      <strong>
        <u>
          <i>
            And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search
            for your solution?
          </i>

        >The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes
        and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that
        buyer.</i
